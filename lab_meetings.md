# Lab meeting agenda: Autumn 2024
## General lab meeting information
All members of the lab are encouraged to attend lab meetings, including undergraduate student researchers and lab affiliates.
Each academic year we will start lab meetings with a review of lab practices and provide opportunities for feedback on these practices. 
Other lab meetings rotate between individual updates (plan on roughly 5 minutes of content on what you've been working on) and focused topics such as paper discussions, practice talks, etc.
**This quarter, lab meetings are held on Tuesdays at 12pm in LSB 302.** Participants are encouraged to bring their lunches.

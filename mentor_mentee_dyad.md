# Mentor–Mentee Dyad Expectations

## Mentor–Mentee Expectations and Mentorship Style
- **Mentorship approach**
  - I acknowledge being new and learning; I am open to feedback and am willing to fix mistakes when aware of them.
  - I sometimes prioritizes efficiency over collegiality but I am committed to improvement when issues are raised.
  - I value open communication, formalized approaches to ensure transparency and clear expectations.
  - My students are my top priority, and I strive to make a distinction between my expectations for myself (e.g. tenure) and for trainees. 
  
- **Meeting frequency and structure**
  - Weekly meetings for graduate students and technicians.
  - Mentee sets the agenda.
  - Agendas should be sent **48 hours in advance**.
  - A Google Docs system is in development for meeting notes.
  - Meetings can be informal (“fieldwork plans”) or formal, depending on the topic.
  - Quick, unscheduled drop-ins are fine if the PI’s office door is open.
- **Individual Development Plan (IDP)**
  - IDPs are encouraged, especially for longer-term goal-setting and mentoring discussions.
  - For PhD students, we will do an annual IDP starting year 2.

## Communication Preferences
- **Primary channels:** Email and Slack.
  - Slack is great for quick/ casual questions and conversation.
  - Emails are less likely to get "dropped" accidentally and are better for important things (like recommendation letter requests). 
- **For emergencies or social coordination:** Text or call (e.g., freezer failure, group meetups).
  - See lab [contact list](https://github.com/tribblelab/internal/blob/main/contact_info.md) for phone numbers.

---

## Time Off and Scheduling
- Notify PI (me) if out of town for a week or more, ideally a few weeks in advance.
- Meetings are not scheduled during university holidays.
- PhD students should continue working during academic breaks but may take approximately **two weeks of vacation per year**.
- No expectation of undergraduate researchers during academic breaks unless previously discussed. 
- PhD students should notify me (PI) in advance for absences longer than one day.

---

## Feedback and Deadlines
- Feedback on research progress can take place during weekly one-on-one meetings, during lab updates meetings or as-needed for written feedback via email. 
- **Typical turnaround times:**
  - **1–2 weeks** for non-deadline items.
  - **2–3 days** for urgent items with deadlines within two weeks.
  - **2+ weeks** is ideal for major feedback tasks.
- **Reminders:**
  - Send reminders **1 week before** small deadlines and **2 weeks before** major ones.

---

## Conflict Resolution
- First, ideally discuss the issue directly with me (PI).
- If unresolved, escalate to the **graduate program coordinator** or **department chair**.
- The **ombudsperson** and UW Allies are available for serious or sensitive conflicts.
- See [lab safety resource](https://github.com/tribblelab/lab_resources/blob/main/conflict_and_safety_resources.md) for more options.

# Professional Development

## Conference Participation
- Attendance at conferences is encouraged; I (PI) will assist with networking and introductions.
- Typically the lab attends the annual Botany meeting, but students may choose to attend an alternative conference if it better suits their needs
- The lab will cover costs for one conference per year, the default is Botany.
- Students should have opportunities to present research.
- Conferences are valuable for professional exposure and community engagement.

---

## Fellowships and Funding
- PhD students have funding guarantee laid out in offer letter. This funding is for your stipend/ fees, but not your research costs.
- All students are expected to show a good-faith effort to acquire independent funding, resources for finding grants are found in the lab resources GitHub [repo](https://github.com/tribblelab/lab_resources).
- Specifics of funding should be discussed one-on-one. 
- Students are responsible for tracking fellowship and grant deadlines.
- **PI feedback timing:**
  - **2+ weeks** turnaround is ideal for fellowship materials, but urgent deadlines can be accommodated.
- **Reminders:**
  - Send me (PI) reminders **1 week before** small submissions and **2 weeks before** major ones.

---

## Authorship and Publications
- **Authorship order**
  - Student is first author on their publications
  - I (PI) will be **senior author** on core dissertation research; other authors are ordered by **perceived contribution**.
- **Publication expectations**
  - PhD students should aim for **one major publication per dissertation chapter**.
  - Additional papers (side projects) are encouraged if they do not derail primary research.
  - Students are encouraged to publish at least once within their first few years and to have **one chapter submitted before graduation**.
  - The exact expectations for publishing depend on each student's career goals. 
- **Writing process**
  - Student leads manuscript writing and figure development.
  - I (PI) provide feedback and editorial support.

---

## Networking and Career Development
- I (PI) assist with:
  - Connecting students to colleagues.
  - Helping craft professional emails and outreach messages.
  - Encouraging participation in conferences and career development events.

# Additional Sections

## Fieldwork Expectations
-Not required, but will likely be encouraged for most PhD students
- Participation expectations depend on project scope and role.

---

## Undergraduate Volunteers
- Graduate students may recruit undergraduates.
- A **system or guide** for onboarding and mentoring undergraduates should be in place. This is TBD!

---

## Lab Culture
- There should be open discussions about lab culture and diversity.
- The stated lab values on our [lab website](tribblelab.org/values) and in the [mentorship compact](https://github.com/tribblelab/lab_practices/blob/main/mentorship_compact.md) will be revised annually based on lab feedback. 

---

## Department Expectations
- PhD students and postdocs are expected to participate in departmental events (seminars, symposia, recruitment).
- **Service expectations:**
  - Early-stage students focus on research.
  - Later-stage students are encouraged to participate in committees or departmental service as desired.

---

## Lab Equipment and Software
- **Equipment use**
  - Equipment should not be taken home except under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., another pandemic).
  - Equipment may be shared outside of the lab after discussion with me (PI).
- **Software**
  - Some software licences are available on shared lab computers. 
  - Otherwise, use open-source tools or those provided by UW.
- **Early training priorities**
  - Writing, developing computational or bench skills, and designing the dissertation project.

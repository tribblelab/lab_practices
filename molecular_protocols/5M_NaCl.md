## What you’ll need:

• A weigh boat and spatula for measuring powdered reagent  
• A glass bottle, able to hold up to 500mL, for storing your buffer long-term  
• A flask or beaker for mixing your buffer, able to hold up to 500mL  
• A graduated cylinder, measuring up to 500 mL of volume  
• Powdered, lab-grade NaCl

### Making the buffer

1. In your chosen mixing vessel, add 400mL of ultrapure water  
2. Add 146g of NaCl  
    a. **MOST OF THE SALT WILL NOT DISSOLVE IN THIS VOLUME OF WATER**  
3. Top up to 500mL with ultrapure water  
4. Transfer to a stir plate, add a stir bar, and turn the stir on to a reasonable speed  
5. Once the mixture is fully dissolved, remove from stir plate. Transfer mixture to a glass bottle and label, including the date  
6. Autoclave mixture before usage

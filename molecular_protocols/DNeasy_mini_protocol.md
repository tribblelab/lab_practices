## Important Points Before Starting

- If using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit for the first time, read “Important Notes”  
  (see page 18 of the [handbook](lab_practices/images/DNeasy_plant_handbook.pdf))).
- Ensure that you are familiar with operating the TissueRuptor II or the TissueLyser.  
  See “Disruption and homogenization using the TissueRuptor II” or  
  “Disruption and homogenization using the TissueLyser system”  
  (refer to the respective manuals or page 19–20 of the [handbook](lab_practices/images/DNeasy_plant_handbook.pdf))).
- Buffer AP1 may develop a yellow color upon storage. This does not affect the procedure.
- All centrifugation steps are carried out at room temperature in a microcentrifuge.

## Things to Do Before Starting

- Buffer AP1 and Buffer AW1 concentrate may form precipitates upon storage.  
  If necessary, warm to 65°C to redissolve (before adding ethanol to Buffer AW1).  
  Do not heat Buffer AW1 after ethanol has been added.
- Buffer AW2 and Buffer AW1 are supplied as concentrates.  
  Before using for the first time, add the appropriate amount of ethanol (96–100%)  
  as indicated on the bottle to obtain a working solution.
- Preheat a water bath or heating block to 65°C.

## Procedure

1. For disruption using the TissueRuptor II, follow step 2;  
   for disruption using the TissueLyser, follow steps 3–7.  
   Alternatively, tissue can be ground using mortar and pestle with liquid nitrogen  
   (see details in the [handbook](lab_practices/images/DNeasy_plant_handbook.pdf)), page 19).

2. **TissueRuptor II:**  
   Place ≤100 mg wet or ≤20 mg lyophilized tissue into a 2 mL tube.  
   Add liquid nitrogen, freeze for 30 sec, keep submerged, disrupt ~30 sec at full speed.  
   Allow liquid nitrogen to evaporate. Proceed to step 7.  
   _Note: Avoid disrupting frozen material in buffer — see note on page 19 of the [handbook](lab_practices/images/DNeasy_plant_handbook.pdf))._

3. **TissueLyser:**  
   Place sample with 3 mm tungsten carbide bead into 2 mL safe-lock tube.  
   Freeze on dry ice 30 sec. (Not needed for lyophilized tissue.)

4. Place tubes into TissueLyser Adapter Set 2 x 24 and grind 1 min at 30 Hz.

5. Disassemble, refreeze on dry ice 30 sec (not needed for lyophilized tissue).

6. Repeat disruption for 1 min at 30 Hz, reversing positions.  
   _See homogenization tips on page 21 of the [handbook](lab_practices/images/DNeasy_plant_handbook.pdf))._

7. Add 400 µL Buffer AP1 + 4 µL RNase A (100 mg/mL). Vortex thoroughly.  
   No visible clumps should remain.

8. Incubate at 65°C for 10 min. Invert 2–3 times during incubation.

9. Add 130 µL Buffer P3. Mix and incubate on ice 5 min.

10. **Optional but recommended:**  
    Centrifuge 5 min at 20,000 x g to reduce precipitate viscosity  
    (see lysate handling tips on page 25 of the [handbook](lab_practices/images/DNeasy_plant_handbook.pdf))).

11. Transfer lysate to QIAshredder Mini spin column (lilac) in 2 mL tube.  
    Centrifuge 2 min at 20,000 x g.

12. Transfer flow-through to a new tube. Avoid disturbing the pellet.

13. Add 1.5 volumes Buffer AW1 (e.g., 675 µL for 450 µL lysate). Mix by pipetting.  
    _Ensure ethanol has been added to Buffer AW1._

14. Load 650 µL into DNeasy Mini spin column.  
    Centrifuge 1 min at ≥6000 x g. Discard flow-through.

15. Repeat step 14 with remaining sample.

16. Add 500 µL Buffer AW2, centrifuge 1 min at ≥6000 x g. Discard flow-through.

17. Add another 500 µL Buffer AW2, centrifuge 2 min at 20,000 x g to dry membrane.  
    _See membrane handling advice in the “Elution” section, page 26 of the [handbook](lab_practices/images/DNeasy_plant_handbook.pdf))._

18. Transfer column to a clean microcentrifuge tube.  
    Add 100 µL Buffer AE. Incubate 5 min at room temp.  
    Centrifuge 1 min at ≥6000 x g.

19. Repeat elution with another 100 µL Buffer AE, in same or new tube.  
    _Elution optimization guidance is on page 26–27 of the [handbook](./DNeasy_plant_handbook.pdf)._

> ⚠️ **Note:** Do not elute more than 200 µL into a 1.5 mL tube — it may contact the column base.

# Beginner’s Guide to the Wet Lab

## First Steps for New Lab Members

1. **Complete required safety training** based on what you will be doing in the lab.
2. **Get a safety tour from your mentor**  
   (e.g., safety showers, eyewash, spill kit, SOP/SDS location, and Safety Manual).
3. **Label your materials**  
   Put your name on your lab notebook and on your assigned storage area.

## Good Things To Do

### 1. Ask Questions
- If you’re unsure about a protocol, piece of equipment, tool, or rule — **ask someone**.

### 2. Follow Safety Protocols
- Wear appropriate PPE (lab coat, gloves, safety glasses, etc.) based on the protocol.
- Check the SOP for specific PPE requirements.

### 3. Stay Organized
- **Label everything** — samples, bottles, containers, and waste — with:
  - Your name
  - The date
  - The contents  
  > _If someone finds your container, they should know who to contact, what’s inside, how old it is, and how to handle it._

- **Record everything** in your lab notebook.
- **Keep your bench clear.**
  - If you must leave something out, label it with:
    - Your name
    - Date
    - Contents
    - When you’ll return

- **Clean up when finished:**
  - Wash glassware
  - Return supplies to their proper place
  - Wipe down your workspace
  - Properly dispose of waste

### 4. Don’t Eat or Drink
- This is a **molecular lab** — **no exceptions**.

### 5. Report Incidents Immediately
- Report **all spills, accidents, or injuries** (even minor ones) to your mentor or PI.
- Your safety is the **top priority** — nothing is worth risking your health.

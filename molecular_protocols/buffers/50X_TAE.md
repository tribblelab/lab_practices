# 50X TAE Buffer Preparation Instructions

**Designed following [this guide](https://toptipbio.com/tae-buffer-recipe/)**

This protocol will show you how to make 50X TAE buffer, commonly used in gel electrophoresis. This buffer is used both to cast the gel itself AND as running buffer during the experiment. You will need to dilute this down to 1X using HPLC water (remember your m1v1’s?).

## What you’ll need:

• Powdered tris base, **NOT TRIS BUFFER**  
• Glacial Acetic Acid  
• 0.5M EDTA buffer pH 8.0  
• HPLC ultrapure water  
• A weigh boat and spatula for measuring powdered reagent  
• A graduated cylinder for measuring liquid reagent  
• A glass bottle for long-term storage (500mL)  
• Access to a stir plate

## Instructions

### Prior to making the buffer

1. Measure out 121g of tris base, 28.6mL of glacial acetic acid, and 50mL of 0.5M EDTA buffer  
2. Measure out 500mL of HPLC water

### Making the buffer

1. Add the tris base and 350mL of HPLC water to your glass bottle  
2. Add a stir bar and turn on the stir plate — the tris may take a few minutes to dissolve  
3. Add the glacial acetic acid and EDTA to the mixture  
4. Top up to 500mL with HPLC water

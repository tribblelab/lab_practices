# 96-well CTAB extraction (James Beck 2010 - modified Sandy Boles protocol)
<span style="color:red">Tribble Lab will need to modify for UW facilities</span>

## A. Grinding and extracting with CTAB Buffer

1. Add 2 (5/32" diam.) stainless steel ball bearings ([source](http://www.royalsteelballusa.com/)) to each 1.1ml “Neptune mini-tube” ([source](http://www.pretech.nu/products/CLP_Neptune_Tubes.htm)). Be sure to order the appropriate caps for the tubes as well.
2. Sample a small amount of tissue into tubes. (For Boechera, approx. 10 milligrams of tissue yields approx. 300 ng/ul of DNA if the final elution is in 100 ul TE.) Cap the tubes with the strip tab to the tip (A1 position) to make removal easier. Label the end tabs A1-A12. Make sure tubes are in a Neptune rack with holes drilled in the bottoms (this will enable the liquid nitrogen and hot water to infiltrate the racks in later steps).
3. Turn on water bath and check that volume is appropriate for the Neptune tube rack.
4. Prepare fresh CTAB isolation buffer by adding 0.2% β-mercaptoethanol to 2X stock CTAB buffer in a flask (100ul of BME to 50ml of CTAB – enough for one plate).
5. Get 0.5 – 1 liter of liquid nitrogen.
6. Carry to the Willis lab: the liquid nitrogen; a small, shallow cooler; your samples in balanced racks with holey bottoms; the blue autoclave gloves.
7. In the Willis lab, switch on Genogrinder (switch at back). Make sure it is at the 1X setting and that the dial is set for speed 500. Open gently with crescent wrench (1/4 turn). Test your setup to make sure you have a tight fit with your racks (without lids!) and the inserts (found in the drawer below the Genogrinder).
8. Freeze the tissue by dipping the racked tubes (no lids) in a cooler containing a small amount of liquid nitrogen. You can hold the rack with metal centrifuge carriers.
9. Transfer balanced racks immediately to the Genogrinder, add the pre-determined spacers, lock down, close lid with crescent wrench, and grind at the 1X setting, speed 500 for 1 minute (“1500” setting). Longer grinding can result in cracked tubes. Gently open the Genogrinder and remove your samples. Switch off Genogrinder.
10. Back in the Pryer lab, remove strip caps (on a paper towel), being sure to note orientation and taking care not to spread powdered tissue. Add 400µl prepared CTAB buffer to each sample with the 1200 ul multi-channel. The CTAB can be poured into a plastic reservoir for pipetting with the multi-channel. This is best done on the open lab bench, so the powdered tissue doesn't get drawn up by the suction of the fume hood.
11. Carefully re-cap the tubes, add a folded paper towel between the lid and caps, and add the lid. Vortex/shake well to get the powdered tissue mixed with the CTAB. Try to get as much of the tissue in solution with the CTAB, but don’t obsess about every little bit. Incubate the crude extract in a 65°C water bath for 1 hour. Place spare dry block on the Neptune rack to prevent tube opening during the incubation. Remove racks (keep weight on!) and allow to drain/cool for a few (approx. 15) minutes.

## B. Removal of proteins with chloroform:IAA

12. In the hood, add an equal volume (400µl) of chloroform:IAA (24:1) to plant extract. (A convenient mix is 96 ml chloroform and 4 ml isoamyl alcohol.) You can add the chloroform:IAA with the 1200 multichannel pipetter if you want, but decant the chloroform:IAA into a glass dish for pipetting (the mixture will dissolve the plastic reservoirs). Cap tubes securely, add a paper towel to the inside of the lid for security, and mix by inversion (30-50x) to produce an emulsion. (Do first inversion slowly, let settle, then more – to avoid pressure building up and the caps coming off.)
13. Centrifuge balanced racked tubes for 5 min. at 3700 rpm (max setting) in the plate centrifuge to separate the phases. (This can also be done at higher rpm, but 3700 is sufficient.)
14. Remove aqueous (top) phase to clean labeled collection tubes using a 1200 ul multi-channel. (Dump the waste in the chloroform/IAA/ball bearing waste.) Removing the top phase is difficult with a large-volume multi-channel, but can be done if you set the volume for approx. 300 ul, angle the tubes, and go slowly. Avoid the interface!

## C. Precipitation, washing and drying of DNA

15. Add an equal volume of cold isopropanol to the aqueous phase. Cap tubes securely, add a paper towel to the inside of the lid for security, and mix gently (5-10X) by inversion. Precipitate at -20°C overnight. (I assume you could precipitate for far less time, but haven’t experimented).
16. Centrifuge for 20 min. at 3700 rpm in the plate centrifuge. Pour off supernatant. Pour off isopropanol into a glass dish and then remove the excess isopropanol by dragging the tube strip along a paper towel. Be sure drag quickly and in a straight line to avoid cross-contaminating tubes with isopropanol from adjacent tubes. (NOTE-I’ve found that if you wait too long after the centrifuge run ends, then many of the pellets detach from the tubes and this really make it difficult to pour. So be prompt about this step.)
17. Wash pellet by adding 500µl 70% ethanol (pellet will not resuspend), capping tubes, adding a paper towel to the inside of the lid, and very gently vortexing. Spin 10 min. at 3700 rpm to secure pellet to tube side. Pour off the ethanol as in step 16.
18. Air dry pellet overnight on benchtop.
19. Resuspend pellet in 50-100 µl TE. Incubate for 1-2 hours at 37°C (vortexing periodically) to assist with resuspension.

# High Molecular Weight (HMW) CTAB Extraction for FERNS

**Note from David**:  
This document provides two protocols for extraction of HMW DNA optimized for ferns:

- **Protocol 1**: Modification of standard CTAB extraction
- **Protocol 2**: Nuclear isolation procedure

The nuclear isolation method is thought to yield purer DNA by removing debris before lysing the nucleus. 
However, both protocols were found to produce similar quality and quantity of DNA, so selection depends on your specific use case.

### Procedure

#### 0. Pre-Extraction Preparation

1. Sample newly expanding fronds or gametophytes and subject them to darkness for 48 h. We usually sealed the samples in plastic bags, wrapped them in paper, and refrigerated at 4°C to keep the samples fresh during the dark treatment.
2. Bake the autoclaved spatulas and mortars and pestles at 180°C for 8 h to eliminate contamination by nucleases.
3. Prepare 2 mL of 3× CTAB buffer for each sample and add 5 μL of β-ME and 4 mg of PVPP per mL of CTAB buffer. Make the buffer in a 15-mL Falcon tube and dispense 2 mL into a 5-mL tube.
4. Cool centrifuge to 4°C.
5. Preheat the incubator (with adapter for 2-mL tubes) to 55°C.

#### 1. Freeze and Pulverize Tissue

1. Weigh 0.2–0.3 g of fresh tissue and put in a mortar.
2. Add two scoops of liquid nitrogen into the mortar and immediately pulverize the tissue with the pestle. The homogenized tissue should be kept frozen.
3. Use a spatula to transfer the frozen tissue powder to a 5-mL tube containing the 2 mL of CTAB buffer. Do not add the CTAB buffer into the mortar. Invert-shake the 5-mL tubes to mix the tissue powder with the CTAB buffer and place the tubes on a cooling rack.


#### 2. Remove Debris and Lyse Cells

1. Filter the matrix through a 30-µm CellTrics filter into 2-mL tubes. Collect no more than 1 mL of filtrate in each tube and separate into two tubes if necessary.
2. Incubate the samples at 55°C for 10 min. Invert-mix the samples every 3 min.

#### 3. Extract nucleic acids from proteins and other metabolites using chloroform

1. Add 0.5 mL of 100% chloroform to each 2-mL tube. Place the samples on a cooling rack and invert-shake for 5 min.
2. Centrifuge the samples at 13,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min. Transfer the supernatant to new 2-mL tubes using wide-bore pipette tips.
3. Add 1 µL of RNase to each tube, invert-shake gently, and incubate at room temperature for 15 min. Do not vortex the samples.
4. Repeat Step 3.2, but transfer the supernatant into 1.7-mL tubes using wide-bore pipette tips (less than 0.8 mL sample per tube).

#### 4. Precipitate DNA

1. Add a 1/2 volume of cool 100% isopropanol to each tube. Invert-mix the solution. Cool high-salt isopropanol can be used for some challenging samples.
2. Centrifuge the samples under 10,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min. If pellets are not seen, centrifuge for another 10 min. Discard the supernatant.

#### 5. Ethanol Wash

1. Add 200 µL of 70% ethanol (diluted with nuclease-free water) and gently suspend the pellet.
2. Centrifuge the samples under 10,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min. Discard the supernatant.
3. Repeat Steps 1 and 2. Spin down the tubes and remove the ethanol completely using a pipette.

#### 6. Elute DNA

1. Dry the pellets under a chemical hood at room temperature for 3–5 min. Do not overdry the pellets.
2. Dissolve the pellets in each tube in 15–25 µL of nuclease-free water at room temperature for about 10 min and flip the tubes gently to ensure the pellets are well dissolved. Do not vortex the samples.
3. If DNA sequencing is conducted immediately after the extraction, the HMW DNA should be stored at 4°C to avoid unnecessary freeze-thaw cycles. Otherwise, keep one tube or 10-µL aliquot per sample for the quality/quantity examination and preserve the rest of the sample at −80°C for long-term storage.

# Cleanup/Decontamination of Steel Beads for CTAB Extraction

For cleanup/decontamination of steel beads used for grinding plant material in CTAB extraction. After removing aqueous phase supernatant (with DNA), use this protocol to discard organic/chloroform phase and recover and clean the beads for reuse.


## Basic
1)	After grinding, remove beads from tube and put into fishnet (found on the side of the fume hood).
2)	Wet beads with Alconox solution and scrub by rolling between fingers while still in the fishnet. Scrub for ca. 3-4 minutes.
3)	Rinse with tap water for ca. 3-4 minutes.
4)	Rinse with de-ionized water for ca. 3-4 minutes.
5)	Put beads onto either Kim-wipe or paper towel to remove excess water.
6)	Put beads into “cleaned but not autoclaved” bead container.

## Bleach decontamination
1)	After grinding, remove beads from tube and put into fishnet (found on the side of the fume hood).
2)	Wet beads with Alconox solution and scrub by rolling between fingers while still in the fishnet. Scrub for ca. 3-4 minutes.
3)	Place beads into a beaker with 10% bleach solution. Allow beads to soak for ca. 30 minutes.
4)	Remove bleach and add tap water to beaker. Soak beads for an equal amount of time that they were in the bleach.
5)	Remove tap water and add deionized water to beaker. Soak beads for an equal amount of time that they were in the bleach.
6)	Put beads onto either Kim-wipe or paper towel to remove excess water.
7)	Put beads into “cleaned but not autoclaved” bead container.

# Cleanup/Decontamination of Steel Beads for CTAB Extraction

For cleanup/decontamination of steel beads used for grinding plant material in CTAB extraction. After removing aqueous phase supernatant (with DNA), use this protocol to discard organic/chloroform phase and recover and clean the beads for reuse.

1. Work in the fume hood due to chloroform.  
2. Place a metal sieve (mesh size small enough to catch beads, but large enough that remaining plant fragments will mostly pass through) over a metal funnel over a large liquid waste bottle. (Chloroform may dissolve plastic.)  
3. Pour the discard (organic phase, balls, remaining plant solids) into the sieve.  
4. Rinse the balls in the sieve with ethanol a few times.  
5. Rinse the balls in the sieve with DI water until they are totally clean.  
6. Pour the balls onto a pile of paper towels and cover with another. Leave to dry in the fume hood.  
7. Pour the dry beads into a lab bottle and autoclave.

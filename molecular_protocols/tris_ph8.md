# Tris Buffer Preparation Instructions

**Designed following [this guide](https://toptipbio.com/tris-hcl-recipe/)**

This protocol outlines how to make 1M Tris buffer at pH 8.0. This is most commonly used for CTAB lysis buffer and for TE buffer (used to store DNA long term).

---

## What you’ll need:

• A glass bottle to store your tris buffer long-term  
• A weigh boat and spatula for measuring powdered reagent  
• A graduated cylinder for measuring liquid reagent  
• A flask or beaker for mixing the buffer  
• A plastic pipette for acid additions during titration  
• Powdered Tris Base  
• Concentrated (usually 35–37%) HCl  
• Access to DI water (any lab sink)  
• Access to a stir plate (Schaeffer lab chem room has two)

## Instructions

### Prior to Making the Buffer

1. **Standardize the pH meter in the Schaeffer lab room:**
   a. Plug the power cable into the meter to turn it on  
   b. Use the three colored beakers near the meter (pH 4.0, 7.0, and 10.0), refill bottles are behind them  
   c. Remove the probe from the electrolyte buffer and gently dry it on a paper towel  
   d. Press the *standardize* button in the top right of the pH meter  
   e. Press the button for 4.0, 7.0, or 10.0, depending on your current standard  
   f. Enter the matching pH value (e.g., 4.0 for pH 4.0)  
   g. Insert the probe into the selected standard  
   h. Once stabilized, press *confirm*, then remove and dry the probe  
   i. Repeat for the other two standards  
   j. **Note:** If you receive a slope error, press *OK* and continue

2. **Measure out your reagents (for 100mL of Tris buffer):**
   a. 80mL of DI water  
   b. ~15mL of HCl in a vessel suitable for pipetting  
   c. 12.11g of powdered tris base (break up clumps)

### Making the Buffer

1. Add 80mL of DI water to your mixing vessel on a stir plate  
2. Add a stir bar and start stirring at a reasonable speed  
3. Add 12.11g of tris base (use a funnel if needed)  
4. Wait for tris to fully dissolve and begin measuring pH (should be ~10.0–10.5)  
5. Slowly pipette in HCl to bring pH down to 8.0:  
   - Start with ~0.1mL increments  
   - Increase to 0.5–1mL as you approach ~pH 8.2  
   - Return to ~0.1mL additions until slightly above pH 8.0  
   - **Note:** Adding DI water will further lower pH, so stop before 8.0

6. Remove the stir bar and top off with DI water until you are 3–5mL from 100mL  
7. Continue adjusting with small volumes of HCl/DI water until:  
   - Final pH = 8.0  
   - Final volume = 100mL

8. Transfer buffer to a glass bottle, label, and include the preparation date  
9. Autoclave buffer prior to usage  
10. If buffer falls out of solution over time, remix using a stir bar

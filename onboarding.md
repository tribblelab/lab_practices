## Lab Policies and Mentorship

- [ ] **Review lab policies and procedures**  
  Read through the [Tribble Lab Practices repository](https://github.com/tribblelab/lab_practices).

- [ ] **Schedule mentorship meeting**  
  Meet with the PI to discuss the **mentorship compact** and **mentorâ€“mentee dyad** documents.

---

## Digital Access

- [ ] **Provide access to digital resources**  
  Grant access as appropriate to:  
  - Lab shared Google Drive
  - Lab GitHub [organization](https://github.com/tribblelab)  
  - [lilNASx](https://github.com/tribblelab/lab_practices/blob/main/server_info.md)  
  - [HYAK](https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/)
  - Shared lab computers

- [ ] **Add your contact information** to the [contact_info](https://github.com/tribblelab/internal/blob/main/contact_info.md) document on GitHub. To edit this document, click the pencil/ edit icon at the upper right corner and see [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/quickstart-for-writing-on-github) for writing in markdown format. Note that this document lives in a private repository only visible to other lab members. We will only use cell phone information as outlined in the [mentorship_compact](https://github.com/tribblelab/lab_practices/blob/main/mentorship_compact.md) and [mentor_mentee_dyad](https://github.com/tribblelab/lab_practices/blob/main/mentor_mentee_dyad.md) documents.

- [ ] **Add lab website profile**
  Use the existing lab members' biographies as an example ([tribblelab.org/team](https://tribblelab.org/team)), and send your photo, bio, pronouns (optional), and socials/ contact information to the PI. She will then add your profile to the website.

## Molecular Lab Access

Complete the following **required safety trainings** before working in the wet lab:

- [ ] [Liquid Nitrogen Safety](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/training/liquid-nitrogen-safety-online)  
- [ ] [Fire Extinguisher Training](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/training/fire-extinguisher-training-online)  
- [ ] [Managing Laboratory Chemicals](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/training/managing-laboratory-chemicals-online)  
- [ ] [Fume Hood Training](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/training/fume-hood-training-online)

- [ ] Once all trainings are complete, record your completion in the [Safety Trainings Spreadsheet](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1BtiMnVqTWQKF9rYF_aulB1vvZxq-NE3c0_LEdKh-x2Y/edit?usp=sharing__;!!K-Hz7m0Vt54!k9WFPTDmiu90a9z_AUDf5tvNnpFIb9Iyq8R-SBdWregKi-PGcVRdTUHOIku3QubhW2XEZ80WrmNn55lFY6pKVaYtv4g$).

Before beginning any procedure:

- [ ] Review the appropriate protocol in the [molecular_protocols section of the lab_practices repository](https://github.com/tribblelab/lab_practices/tree/main/molecular_protocols). If your procedure does not have a protocol in this repository, make one. 
- [ ] Review the relevant SDS sheets and SOPs in the [wet_lab directory](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1J7hvO_3rrFGMuC97lV8Th66K7FN8YiBe?usp=drive_link) on the lab shared Google Drive. For new protocols, be sure to add any new SDS sheets and/or SOPs.

**Once complete:**  
- [ ] Confirm with the PI or lab manager that all onboarding steps are finished.
